Your options are to pass in a custom token (perhaps by creating some sort of 'service' user and creating a personal access token with the correct permissions) or to turn off `on-failed-regex-request-changes` and use action failure to prevent merges instead (with `on-failed-regex-fail-action: true`).

            Don't worry, if you can't fix the problem with the PR title, a person who takes care of things will handle it.
            We use precise git commit title formatting for readable messages and to generate auto releases and change log:
            \<type\>: \<description\>
            Where \<type\> must be one of the following: 
            - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
            - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts
            - docs: Documentation only changes
            - feat: A new feature
            - fix: A bug fix
            - perf: A code change that improves performance
            - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
            - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
            - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

          on-succeeded-regex-dismiss-review-comment: |
            PR title matches our git commit title formatting guidelines. All good!
